CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:1 (project):
  cmake_minimum_required() should be called prior to this top-level project()
  call.  Please see the cmake-commands(7) manual for usage documentation of
  both commands.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:1 (project):
  Policy CMP0048 is not set: project() command manages VERSION variables.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0048" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  The following variable(s) would be set to empty:

    CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION
    CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR
    CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR
    CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

boost-multiprecision provides CMake targets:

  # this is heuristically generated, and may not be correct
  find_package(boost_multiprecision CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE Boost::multiprecision)

cli11 provides CMake targets:

  # this is heuristically generated, and may not be correct
  find_package(CLI11 CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE CLI11::CLI11)

cli11 provides pkg-config modules:

openssl is compatible with built-in CMake targets:

  find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE OpenSSL::SSL)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE OpenSSL::Crypto)

The package libpq provides CMake integration:

    find_package(PostgreSQL REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE PostgreSQL::PostgreSQL)

CMake Deprecation Warning at src/common/libconfig/CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

CMake Warning (dev) at /Users/haruhi/.vcpkg-clion/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake:598 (_add_executable):
  Policy CMP0003 should be set before this line.  Add code such as

    if(COMMAND cmake_policy)
      cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW)
    endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)

  as early as possible but after the most recent call to
  cmake_minimum_required or cmake_policy(VERSION).  This warning appears
  because target "mysql_replicater" links to some libraries for which the
  linker must search:

    CLI11, dl

  and other libraries with known full path:

    /Users/haruhi/ClionProjects/mysql-replicater/src/access/libaccess.a
    /Users/haruhi/ClionProjects/mysql-replicater/src/access/table/libtab1.a
    /Users/haruhi/ClionProjects/mysql-replicater/src/access/common/libacesscomm.a
    /Users/haruhi/ClionProjects/mysql-replicater/cmake-build-debug/vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/debug/lib/libpq.a
    /Users/haruhi/ClionProjects/mysql-replicater/cmake-build-debug/vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/lib/libpgport.a

  CMake is adding directories in the second list to the linker search path in
  case they are needed to find libraries from the first list (for backwards
  compatibility with CMake 2.4).  Set policy CMP0003 to OLD or NEW to enable
  or disable this behavior explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0003" for
  more information.

CMake Warning at /Users/haruhi/.vcpkg-clion/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake:598 (_add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe linker search path for target mysql_replicater
  because there is a cycle in the constraint graph:

      dir 5 must precede it due to link library [libpgport.a]
    dir 5 is [/Users/haruhi/ClionProjects/mysql-replicater/cmake-build-debug/vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/lib]
      dir 4 must precede it due to link library [libpq.a]

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
